# Local Data Visualization Tool 

I am working on a MacOS desktop application for data cleaning and analytics. This data tool allows users to go from raw data to insights faster. This application is for anyone that builds decks for clients and would like better visualizations. 


## Essential Visualizations
 - **Bar & Column Charts:** Vertical and Horizontal, with support for stacking (stacked or 100% stacked_ and grouping. 
  - **Line & Area Charts:** Used for time-series and trend analysis. 
  - **Scatter Plots:** Used when showing relationships and distributions between two numeric variables.
  - **Histograms:** For frequency distribution analysis. 
  - **Tables & Pivot Tables:** High-Performance grids for raw data exploration.

2. Advanced & "Infinite Canvas" Visuals
- **Metric Trees / Maps:** Visualizing KPIs in a hierarchical flow (e.g., Revenue -> Orders -> AOV).
- **Funnel Charts:** Specifically designed for marketing and product onboarding flows (e.g., Visit -> Signup -> Purchase).
- **Heat Maps:** For matrix-style data density visualization.
- **Big Number (KPI) Cards:** Large, scaled-up numbers for top-level metrics.
- **Sankey / Flow Diagrams:** Showing the movement of data or users between states.

3. Specialized Analytical Templates
- **Customer Journey Maps:** Combining charts with sticky notes and flow arrows.
- **A/B Test Visuals:** Specialized views to compare control vs. variant groups.
- **GA4 / Website Analytics Maps:** Pre-built flows for web traffic.
- **OKRs & Alignment Canvases:** Mixing data with strategic planning shapes.
